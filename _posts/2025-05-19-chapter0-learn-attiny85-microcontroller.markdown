ATtiny85 microcontroller gained a great popularity among Engineers and enthusiasts. This is largely due to its small size, tons of features and low cost. ATtiny85 will be great fit for robotics, wearable and power based projects. As an initiative for learning this ATtiny85 microcontroller quicker and easier we have structured the tutorial that can be covered in matter of ten days.


The below tutorial will be effective when you practice “Try this out” exercises at the end of every tutorial.

Day 1:

What is ATtiny85 microcontroller and what are the features of ATtiny85. Guide to use GPIO pins of this microcontroller as input and output.
