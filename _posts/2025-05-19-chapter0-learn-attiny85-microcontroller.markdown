ATtiny85 microcontroller gained a great popularity among Engineers and enthusiasts. This is largely due to its small size, tons of features and low cost. ATtiny85 will be great fit for robotics, wearable and power based projects. As an initiative for learning this ATtiny85 microcontroller quicker and easier we have structured the tutorial that can be covered in matter of ten days.


The below tutorial will be effective when you practice “Try this out” exercises at the end of every tutorial.

Day 1:

What is ATtiny85 microcontroller and what are the features of ATtiny85. Guide to use GPIO pins of this microcontroller as input and output.

* [Introduction to ATtiny85 microcontroller & configuring GPIO as output](chapter1-attiny85-microcontroller-tutorial-gpio-output.html)
* [Configuring GPIO as input](chapter2-attiny85-gpio-input.html)

Day 2:

What is Timer feature in a ATtiny85 microcontroller and how to configure them and use it with interrupts to generate time delay.

* [ATtiny85 : Using timers & Interrupts to generate time delay](chapter3-attiny85-timer-tutorial-generating-time-delay-interrupts.html)

Day 3:

What is counters ? How it is related to timer peripheral. Guide to configure counter in ATtiny85 microcontroller and use it to count events, signals, clock pulses etc.

* [ATtiny85 : Using counters & Interrupts to count events and signals](chapter4-attiny85-counter-counting-events-signals-interrupts.html)

Day 4:

What is compare match feature ? Advantages of using compare match with timers. Guide to configure compare match and use it with interrupts in ATtiny85 microcontroller.

* [ATtiny85 : Compare match with interrupts](chapter5-attiny85-compare-match-tutorial-interrupts.html)

Day 5:

Pulse width modulation or PWM pulse generation in ATtiny85 microcontroller. There are two modes : Fast PWM and Phase correct PWM each has unique characteristics.
